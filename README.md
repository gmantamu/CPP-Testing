# C++ Testing

# A general repo for learning the C++ language and the many components that come with it
# Mainly just adding projects and files that cover main topics and components of the coding language

# Rule of Three
# Created a class with a deconstructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment constructor. The main goal is to get more comfortable with the syntax of C++, and to contunualy work with dynamic memory to avoid excessive debugging that stems from memory leaks
